### NPM workspaces

The repository uses NPM workspaces for better management of dependencies

Therefore, the repository should be initialized in the root folder by running the command `npm install` and not in the sub directories (although there are package.json files, but these files are just handling the local dependencies)

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Repository initialization

- run `npm run build:shared-types` to build shared types library
- run `npm install` in root directory
- if building with electron: Install Electron-Builder globally by running: `npm install electron -g`

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Development

- Adding a new workspace: `npm init -w ./path/to/workspace/directory`
- Adding packages to workspace: `npm install -w ./path/to/workspace/directory package --save` (in workspace root directory)

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## External Dependencies

- The following dlls need to be placed in the `external` directory for use with the associated depth cameras
- ~~**Intel RealSense R2/D435/L515** `Intel.Realsense.dll`, `libpxcclr.cs.dll`, `libpxccpp2c.dll`, `realsense2.dll` from [Intel RealSense SDK](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases)~~ (Files are included as nuget package)
- **Microsoft Kinect** `Microsoft.Kinect.dll`, `Microsoft.Kinect.xml` from [Microsoft Kinect for Windows SDK 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561)
- for compatibility reasons, no sensors are included in the build process by default. To include specific sensors use the appropriate flags described in the Server documentation

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

## use shared code

- for using `reflex-shared-types` in another project, just install it as workspace dependency in the current project with

  ```bash
    npm install ./packages/reflex-shared-types -w ./tools/ReFlex.TrackingServer/ClientApp --save
  ```

- types are available by importing `@reflex/shared-types`

### Known issues

- Electron seems not to be perfectly suitable to be used in monorepos, as building the app in the package process removes all dev dependencies, including the `electron-builder` package if installed locally  
  Therefore, `electron-builder` needs to be installed globally before executing a `build:emulator:electron-xxx` script
- Additionally, `npm install` is executed after packaging to restore the dev dependencies
- if a command `build:emulator:electron-xxx` is executed from within the emulator project, `npm install` has to be executed manually afterwards
- test and `build-complete` commands start a headless Chrome instance and therefore require Chrome to be installed and path to Chrome binary to be set in PATH.

## Python gRPC Processing service

- as an example for integrating external services, a python gRPC service for extracting interactions from the camera depth image is provided in `services/python-backend`
- service is consumed when setting Interaction Processor to `Remote`
- in the `ReFlex.TrackingServer`, the service is configured in `Services/RemoteInteractionProcessingService.cs`
- Documentation: [Python gRPC service](services/python-backend/README.md)

## Known issues / Troubleshooting

- `Karma Test Explorer` Plugin for vs code does not work well with the current npm workspace setup, as it does not identify the correct angular path. In order to use the plugin, the global angular installation is used as fallback.
- if an application behaves different when executing the packaged electron version (either installed using the setup or the executable in the `win-unpacked directory)`), this may be caused by outdated Electron Cache. In this case, open
  - `%AppData%` Folder (Windows)
  - `~/.config` Folder (Linux)
  - `~/Library/Application Support/` (MacOS)  
    and delete the app folder there
- to delete all temporary folders / cached packages / build artifacts, run the following command in the `scripts` folder:

  ```bash
   ./cleanup_packages.sh package-directories.txt
  ```
