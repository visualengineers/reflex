# {{ page.title }}

Actuated displays are [shape-changing interfaces]({{ site.baseurl }}/knowledge/terms/shape-changing-interface) with active deformation property. Most of the existing actuated display implementations are tabletop displays with a surface that is malleable through direct touch input or freehand gestures. Motorized pins controlled individually by a computer algorithm create the shape of the display. Front or rear projection is used to render visual output on the surface. In contrast to this approach, other applications use shape memory alloys and a capacitive sensor for actuation and interaction. Direct light emission with integrated LEDs creates the visualization.

One of the main limitations of actuated display techniques is the mechanical complexity, resulting in high realization costs. Among a huge range of research prototypes therefore only few commercial displays (such as Braille displays for visually impaired people) exist.

## Examples

The **TableHop** tabletop display provides self-actuated deformation and vibro-tactile feedback in combination with high-resolution rear projection. Frequency modulation in the high-voltage circuit allows to sense where the user's fingertip touches the surface. To create surface deformations up to ±5 mm, spandex fabric is electrostatically actuated using transparent indium tin oxide electrodes on its underside.

**inFORM** is a Dynamic Shape Display that renders digital 3D content and allows unsers to interact with it in a tangible way. inFORM can also interact with the physical world around it, for example moving objects on the table's surface. Remote participants can be displayed physically, allowing the ability to interact physically at a distance.

**Relief** is an actuated tabletop display, which is able to render and animate 3D shapes with a malleable surface. Users can experience and form digital models projected on the surface (e.g. geographical terrain) in an intuitive manner. 120 motorized pins, controlled with low-cost, open-source platforms, actuate the surface. Each pin can be addressed individually and senses user input like pulling and pushing.

**Lumen** is an interactive display that presents visual images and physical moving shapes, both controlled independently using shape mempry alloys and a capacitive sensor.  Users interact with Lumen directly, forming shapes and images with their hands. The smooth, organic physical motions provide aesthetically pleasing, calm displays for ambient computing environments.
